This is a sample project that I completed for one of my courses through UC Berkeley's Extension program.  Using the nhanes.csv datafile that exists in this repository, I go through a series of steps to explore the data and then run various models on the data, using area under curve ("AUC" as evaluation criteria to identify the model that yields the best performance.
